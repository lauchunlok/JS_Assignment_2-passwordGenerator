> Coming back to this well-trodden exercise after ChatGPT was released, every TODO feature has become 10 times easier. Implementing new features, especially on this well-established project, can be accomplished with just 2-3 prompts.

# JS_Assignment_2-passwordGenerator

Design File: https://www.figma.com/file/YRO9Iw5IYaOorjnRyNz4bV/Random-Password-Generator?node-id=0%3A1

Demo:

### TODO

-   ~~1-click copy password to the clipboard~~
-   More scalable on the number of password being generated (can be increase/decrease from 4 to 2/6)
-   The assignment leaves a lot of flexibility on design. If time permits try to stick to the design file as an exercise.
