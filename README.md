# JS_Assignment_2-passwordGenerator

Design File: https://www.figma.com/file/YRO9Iw5IYaOorjnRyNz4bV/Random-Password-Generator?node-id=0%3A1


### TODO
- 1-click copy password to the clipboard
- More scalable on the number of password being generated (can be increase/decrease from 4 to 2/6)
- The assignment leaves a lot of flexibility on design. If time permits try to stick to the design file as an exercise.
